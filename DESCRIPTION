Description: Classification of hierarchically structured outcomes and 
  corresponding, suitable performance and loss measures. Currently, top-down
  hierarchical classification using random forests as local classifiers is
  implemented.
  The performance/loss measures implemented include the hierarchical F-score,
  the (weighted) shortest path distance, and the H-loss.
